    "Number one: Everyone knows that carrots are the bunny's food of choiceâ€¦ or is it? As it turns out, this happens to be a myth! As root vegetables like carrots have high amounts of sugar, they prove to be quite bad for the health of the rabbit. Instead, they tend to prefer hay and other kinds of veggies!{p=1.5}{nw}"
    "Number two: Bunnies may seem cute and cuddly, but in reality, they have an unexpected dark side. Did you know that they love to drink the blood of their enemies? This can be explained scientifically through consuming the blood of other bunnies can lengthen their lifespan.{p=1.5}{nw}"
    "Number three: Despite their small appearance, bunnies can never get enough of a good feast. They are known to have near endless stomachs, to the point that if they are not willing to eat, you should take them to a veterinarian center as soon as possible.{p=1.5}{nw}"
